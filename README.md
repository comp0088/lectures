# Lectures for COMP0088 Introduction to Machine Learning

This repository contains lecture materials for the [COMP0088 Introduction to Machine Learning](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1442) module for taught MSc students at UCL, delivered in Autumn 2021.

**Slides and video links for each week will be uploaded on the Friday before the week to which they apply.**

Lecture videos are streamed from [UCL MediaCentral](https://mediacentral.ucl.ac.uk), which *should* adapt delivery to be appropriate for your device. If you don't have the time or patience to sit through the videos, the slides include much of the dry content, though with less explanation, narrative and handwaving.

Don't forget to check out the [labs](https://github.com/comp0088/labs) repository for the weekly coding exercises.
